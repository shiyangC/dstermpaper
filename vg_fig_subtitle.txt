In figure#, the system consists of five non-faulty processes and one faulty process. Originally the non-faulty processes decided on coordinates arranged in a pentagon shape. The faulty process, however, has a random point outside of the pentagon. The goal of the algorithm is to have the non-faulty processes agree on a point inside the safe area, denoted by the marked inner pentagon on the graph. Throughout each iteration, even though the faulty process produces faulty value that caused the consensus to diverge, the diveged consensus values are then used as the input to the next iterations (the convex hull of each iteration is denoted with a roman numeral). We notice that the consensus areas proceed to a small point-like area, inside the original safe area.
In figure#, the system consists of seven non-faulty processes and two faulty processes. On faulty point is visible outside of the region marked by the non-faulty processes arranged in a 7-sided polygon. Another faulty point is not visible, inside the convex hull of the non-faulty processes. The safe area of the n=9, f=2 configuration is much smaller, but the non-faulty processes still manage to converge into the safe area after several iterations.
