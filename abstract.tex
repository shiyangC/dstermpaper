\emph This paper introduce two algorithms which mean
to resolve the multidimensional agreement in Byzantine
system. The paper introduce what is the multidimensional
agreement Byzantine problem, and the differences between
the multidimensional Byzantine problem and the original
Byzantine General problem. And describe the related techniques
to resolve this problem.

We also make a comparison of the convergence rate between
both of the algorithms. We make a simulation of the running
process.
