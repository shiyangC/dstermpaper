\section{Comparison Evaluation}
The MH algorithm and VG algorithm are both designed to solve
multidimensional approximate agreement problems. But they use
different methods to get the result. They get different properties
and limitations, and specific application constraints. The HM
algorithm depends on the barycenter of the safe area. The VG
algorithm depends on upper bound and lower bound of the value.

Research proposed that MH algorithm has a faster convergence rate.
From the equations, it is hard to tell. The situations is the
property are different, and it is hard to directly compare both
of the algorithms. 

\subsection{Time complexity}
To compare these algorithms, we choose some value of the setup.
And we use the different dimension as the x-axis to plot the 
number of iterations. The y-axis is the number of iteration.

I choose both $\epsilon$ as 0.5, I assume
$U - v$ as 2, $\gamma$ is 0.5 to plot picture. The dimension is
from 1 to 50. The maximun $\delta_{U}(m)$ is choosed by 1 shown
in fig-\ref{fig:M1}.

\begin{figure}
\input{plot.tikz}
\caption{Rounds of Iteration} \label{fig:M1}
\end{figure}

From this plot, we can tell that VG algorithm need more iteration
to get converge. And each iteration number is increasing as the 
dimension increasing.

When we choose the a different set of value, the maximun $\delta_{U}(m)$ is choosed by 2.
Using $U - v$ as 4 and plot the number of convergences from
dimension 1 to 50 shown in fig-\ref{fig:M2}.

\begin{figure}
\input{plot_1.tikz}
\caption{Round of Iteration} \label{fig:M2}
\end{figure}

From this plot we can tell that these two figure is similar, so we 
want to reduce the value of $\gamma$ to 0.1. The plot is following shown
in fig-\ref{fig:M3}.

\begin{figure}
\input{plot_2.tikz}
\caption{Round of Iteration} \label{fig:M3}
\end{figure}

From this plot we can tell that when $\gamma$ goes to 0, the iteration
of VG algorithm will decrease dramaticlly shown in fig\ref{fig:M4}. We
try to plot the Vaidya-Garg algorithm using a small value which is 0.001.
The $\gamma$ is typically will be a relative small number. We can see
that, when the dimension is increasing, the convergence will become slow.

\begin{figure}
\input{plot_3.tikz}
\caption{Round of Iteration} \label{fig:M4}
\end{figure}

From this plot we can see that when $U - v$ is growing, the iteration
time will keep increasing. 


In figure \ref{fig:M5}, the system consists of five non-faulty processes and one 
faulty process. Originally the non-faulty processes decided on coordinates 
arranged in a pentagon shape. The faulty process, however, has a 
random point outside of the pentagon. The goal of the algorithm is 
to have the non-faulty processes agree on a point inside the safe area,
denoted by the marked inner pentagon on the graph. Throughout each 
iteration, even though the faulty process produces faulty value that 
caused the consensus to diverge, the diveged consensus values are 
then used as the input to the next iterations (the convex hull of 
each iteration is denoted with a roman numeral). We notice that the 
consensus areas proceed to a small point-like area, inside the original 
safe area.

In figure \ref{fig:M6}, the system consists of seven non-faulty processes and 
two faulty processes. On faulty point is visible outside of the 
region marked by the non-faulty processes arranged in a 7-sided 
polygon. Another faulty point is not visible, inside the convex 
hull of the non-faulty processes. The safe area of the $n=9, f=2$ 
configuration is much smaller, but the non-faulty processes still 
manage to converge into the safe area after several iterations.
